# Make Times Forward

Display the (linear) schedule of an event. No backend, pure browser application that can run completely offline once it
is loaded.

## Usage

All data lives in LocalStorage. Create or modify your schedule in edit mode, show it in display mode, it's that simple!

You can even play a sound when the next schedule item starts. You can also turn that off because sound can be annoying.
In case you speak German, you will also be annoyed by the horrible pun that gave this app its name.
